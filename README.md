# Liberty Knowledge Base

We scrapped online HTML books from the Mises Institute and converted them into markdown (a textual format).
The textual format is leaner and easier for LLM AIs do interact with. A markdown file can usually either be attached as an external file or inserted as inline context.

## Webpage

You can view [this project's webpage](https://atras-do-arwario.github.io/liberty-knowledge-base/) for an easier book selection, text visualization and section copying.

## Files

You can also navigate the file tree in this project. The list of markdown content is under `content/markdown/`.
